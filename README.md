# My Web Development Journey

## Introduction
This repository serves as a journal of my web development learning journey, documenting the progress I've made through various lab assignments and projects. Each entry represents a stepping stone in my growth as a developer, complete with challenges faced, solutions discovered, and skills acquired along the way.

## My Learning Path

### Week 1: First Steps into HTML
My journey began with the basics of HTML. I remember being confused about proper document structure at first, but by the end of the week, I was confidently creating semantic markup. Creating my first properly structured web page felt like building a foundation for everything to come.

### Week 2: Styling with CSS
This week introduced me to the world of CSS. The concept of selectors initially seemed overwhelming, but through practice, I began to understand the cascade and how to target specific elements. My favorite discovery was flexbox - suddenly, layouts that seemed impossible became straightforward!

### Week 3: JavaScript Fundamentals
JavaScript brought my static pages to life. I struggled with the concept of event handling at first, but the satisfaction of creating my first interactive form made the effort worthwhile. The "aha!" moment came when I successfully implemented my first form validation function.
